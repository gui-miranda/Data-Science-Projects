# Guilherme Cardoso Miranda
<sub>*Frelancer Data Scientist* at Upwork</sub>

I am a undergraduate student in Engineer Physics and I have a solid experience with Statics , Analitical Descriptions and Scientific Computation. My major hability is help to understand and solve bussines problems using machine learning models, in especially recomendation systems, perfoming them from the web scraping to the implementation of the model.

I am also experienced in the construction of models using Linear and Logistical Regressions and optmize then using their metrics to make the models as close to reality as possible.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Statistics and Physics.
